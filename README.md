## üåü Features

- **Flexible Inputs**: Support for displaying numbers, strings, and JSX elements. You can even use a combination of these in a single slot counter instance!
- **Animated Changes**: Only the characters that change get animated, bringing life and motion to your app's interface.
- **Customize Animation Settings**: Control the duration of the animation, or decide whether to start the animation automatically upon mounting.
- **Sequential Animation Mode**: A unique feature that provides the option to animate the numbers incrementally or decrementally from the start value to the target value, rather than a random animation.
- **Monospace Font Support**: The useMonospaceWidth prop ensures that all numeric characters occupy the same horizontal space as they would in a monospace font.
- **Infinite List Appearance**: Option to make the list appear as continuous, seamlessly connecting the end of the target character to the beginning.
- **Style Customization**: Easily add custom styles to the characters, separators, and overall container. You can even customize the class name for the slot value.
- **Ref Support**: Control the animation start with a ref for increased flexibility.

Immerse your users in an interactive, engaging, and enjoyable experience with `react-slot-counter`. Whether you're displaying user scores, loading status, or real-time data, `react-slot-counter` adds that extra 'spin' to your numbers and strings.

## ü§ñ Ref

You can access the SlotCounter component using a ref. This ref can be used to start the animation of the component.

| Method           | Description                          |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `startAnimation` | Start the animation of the component |

The `startAnimation` method accepts an optional object with the following properties:

- `duration`: The duration of the animation in seconds. Overrides the `duration` prop.
- `dummyCharacterCount`: The number of dummy characters to be displayed in the animation before reaching the target character. Overrides the `dummyCharacterCount` prop.
- `direction`: This option determines the direction of the slot machine animation. The accepted values are `bottom-top` and `top-bottom`. The default value is `bottom-top`. If `bottom-top` is chosen, the animation will start from the bottom and move towards the top. If `top-bottom` is chosen, the animation will start from the top and move downwards.

Example:

```jsx
import React, { useRef } from 'react';
import SlotCounter, { SlotCounterRef } from 'react-slot-counter';

function App() {
  const counterRef = useRef < SlotCounterRef > null;

  const handleStartClick = () => {
    counterRef.current?.startAnimation();
  };

  return (
    <>
      <SlotCounter value={123456} ref={counterRef} />
      <button onClick={handleStartClick}>Start</button>
    </>
  );
}

export default App;
```
