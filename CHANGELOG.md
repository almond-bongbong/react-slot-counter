## 3.0.4

_2024-12-19_

## 3.0.3

_2024-12-18_

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where `sequentialAnimationMode` did not properly transition from `startValue` to `value`.
- Resolved a problem where CSS transitions would not trigger correctly on low-performance devices, improving overall performance.

## 3.0.2

_2024-12-04_

### Added

- Added `reload` ref method to force re-render the SlotCounter component. This provides more control over component rendering and helps handle dynamic style updates.

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where animations would unnecessarily trigger during window resize events, improving stability and user experience. [#61](https://github.com/almond-bongbong/react-slot-counter/pull/61)

## 3.0.1

_2024-07-20_

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where the delay was incorrectly calculated by not excluding separator characters. [#55](https://github.com/almond-bongbong/react-slot-counter/pull/55)

## 3.0.0

_2024-06-27_

### Added

## 2.3.0

### Added

- Introduced `numberSlotClassName` and `numberClassName` props for more customization options. These props allow you to set the class name for the number slot and the number, respectively, enabling you to customize their styling.
